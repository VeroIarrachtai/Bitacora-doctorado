Previously (a√±o) the criteria used in the Recovery Zones have been to use native and introduced species (Plan de manejo, 2006). Although the introduction of non-native species of plants contributes to the protection of the soil and the infiltration of water, it also displaces the wild fauna, since it constitutes habitat conditions different from the original ones that, in addition to being in constant extension, do not provides the necessary services, which causes the fauna to move to other areas. This is critical if we consider that the areas surrounding the forest are also subject to similar factors of deterioration, with which practically, it is condemned to have smaller and smaller animal populations. For all these reasons, the importance and urgency of restoring the vegetation cover with native species is evident. From the year XX(ref), reforestations with native species were carried out, but they left out the inclusion of genetic variation in the plant populations to be reforested that would allow their population health in the face of biotic and abiotic phenomena to which the species are subjected in their natural environment. Therefore, it is urgent to maintain and increase the native vegetation that allows the recomposition of the natural structure of the forest, increasing the quality of the habitat and the maintenance of the intertwined populations of flora and fauna.
